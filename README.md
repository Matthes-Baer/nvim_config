# Setup
- git clone this repository (this is based on https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) in `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim` (on Windows; `~/.config/nvim` on Linux)
- Optionally remove .git folder to create a separate repository: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
- Install LazyGit: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
- Install LLVM (clang) (not mingw) -> https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Windows-support
  - Don't forget to add bin folder to PATH
- Install Lazydocker: https://winget.ragerworks.com/package/JesseDuffield.Lazydocker
- To have spellchecking by NeoVim for other languages than English, you have to add spell files.
  - _The following explanation is for understanding what was done, to make the German spell check work, all this is already added in this repository. There is no additional action required, the following is just extra information:_
  - The `options.lua` file is set up, to have a custom spell file directory in `\nvim` (based on your custom configs path), since otherwise you would have to start NeoVim in a terminal with administrator privileges and download the needed files on startup (this won't work, if you don't have the admin permissions).
  - The files you need are `de.utf-8.spl`, `de.utf-8.sug`, and `de.utf-8.add` for German.
  - If you are not using the admin permission way, you would have to manually download two of the files which can be done through:
    - `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://ftp.nluug.nl/vim/runtime/spell/de.utf-8.spl" -OutFile "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\spell\de.utf-8.spl"` (in PowerShell)
    - `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://ftp.nluug.nl/vim/runtime/spell/de.utf-8.sug" -OutFile "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\spell\de.utf-8.sug"` (in PowerShell)
    - If you want to add special words to the spell list (like "PowerShell"), you have to manually add a `de.utf-8.add` file in the same directory where your other spell files are stored. NeoVim will then automatically also create a `de.utf-8.add.spl` file in the same directory.
    - This manual setup won't interfere with any spell files placed in the system-wide installation directory of NeoVim since it checks this directory and any custom directories if setup properly, therefore the default English spellchecks can still remain in their original place and don't need to be moved
    - I don't know how to set all this up for multiple additional languages
    
# Basic Usage
- `<C-o>` would be CTRL + o
- `<s-down>` would be Shift + down_arrow
- Use `bn` or `bp` to switch buffers on same window and close buffers with `bd` OR use Leader key + "," to go through all active buffers
  - With the buffer from window you can search by file name or number and can use arrow keys to go through all buffers besides the current active one
  - Use `Shift + L` to navigate to the forward/right buffer, and use `Shift + H` to move the backwards/left buffer from the current
- Use Mason (package manager for NeoVim) to install language servers, linters, formatters, and other developer tools
- When having multiple tabs (not just regular buffers), use `gt` to switch to the next tab, or `gT` to switch to the previous tab (`tabn` and `tabp` would also work)
- Search in file: `<S-?>`
- You can use `:cd` within NeoVim to switch the cwd
- See the current cwd: `:pwd`
- To set the cwd to the directory of the currently open file: `:cd %:p:h`
- Use `<s-k>` on anything code-related holding information to get the info you probably know from VS Code when hovering over it 
- Use `:LspRestart` to restart the LSP tool. Use `:LspInfo` for more information on it.
- Add specific words to the spell file list: `zg` (not with `:`, just press `zg`, while the cursor is on the word)

## Plugins

### Diffview
- Use `:DiffviewOpen` to open the merge-conflict resolver tool, use `:h diffview-merge-tool` to get information on how to use it more effectively 

### LazyGit
- LazyGit Commands: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#features
  - `p` for pulling, `<s-p>` for Pushing, `q` to leave
  - Use <s-â†‘|â†“> (arrow keys) to select multiple commits, for example

### NeoTree
- Use `<leader>e` to open Neo-tree
- Use `<S-h>` to toggle showing hidden items while on the NeoTree screen
- Use `<S-r>` to reload (when new files were created, for example)

### Lazydocker
- Open Lazydocker: `<leader>ld`
- To exit the exec shell in a docker from Lazydocker: `<C-d>`
- Use `x` to see all shortcuts inside Lazydocker (like `[` or `]` to switch tabs inside the right panel)

## Terminal
- Open ToggleTerm as tab: `:ToggleTerm direction=tab`
- When in `terminal` mode use `CTRL + ALT + ÃŸ` (or `CTRL + \`) and then `<C-n>` to leave the `terminal` mode and switch to `normal` mode
  - Actually press the `CTRL` key first, not all at the same time
  - Use `<C-7>` to close the terminal
- Open a normal terminal (not ToggleTerm) with `:split terminal` or use `<leader>ft or T`

## File Management
- `<leader>fn` to create new file, then `:edit file_name` to name it
- `<leader>fb` to get to file browser and select files via `Tab` and delete with `d` while in normal mode
  - Commands: `https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-file-browser.nvim#Mappings`
  - Within the file browser use `c` in normal mode to create new folders and files
  - Within the file browser, use `r` to rename a file, `<S-r>` for replace


# Troubleshooting

- If packages seem broken, try deleting the corresponding nvim-data folder section and restart nvim to trigger a full installation
  - `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data\lazy\nvim-treesitter"` for example (on Windows)
- When using Rust with the rust-analyzer LSP plugin and you have an `proc-macro not been built yet` error, try `cargo check` in the terminal and then saving/reloading the file

- Mit Next.js-Projekt oder so rumprobieren, um zu testen, welche Common commands mir fehlen wÃ¼rden (bspw. STRG + . oder zur File zu springen etc.?)
- NeoTest fÃ¼r Jest und Rust ausprobieren (in general.lua plugin file)


# Additional Information

## LazyVim

- LazyVim looks for `lua/config/options.lua`, `lua/config/keymaps.lua`, and `lua/config/autocmds.lua` automatically during startup.
- When LazyVim starts, it sources `lua/config/options.lua`, applying all settings inside it.
- This happens before plugins are loaded, ensuring that global options (like vim.opt.spelllang) take effect immediately.
- By default, NeoVim stores custom words in ~/.config/nvim/spell/en.utf-8.add (for English). You can manually edit this file if needed.


## Treesitter (through nvim-treesitter)

Treesitter is mainly used for syntax highlighting and code parsing. It provides:
âœ… Better syntax highlighting (more accurate than regex-based Vim highlighting).
âœ… Indentation improvements (better auto-indent).
âœ… Folding, text objects, and query-based features.

ðŸ‘‰ It does NOT provide autocompletion or error checking.

## LSP (Language Server Protocol) (through Mason)
LSP is a protocol that allows editors like Neovim to communicate with language servers, providing features like auto-completion, go to definition, hover documentation, and more for various programming languages.

Neovim has built-in support for LSP (starting from version 0.5), and using LSP makes the editor aware of your code structure, improving the development experience.

LSP provides:
âœ… Autocompletion (e.g., lua-language-server suggests functions).
âœ… Go-to definition, hover documentation, refactoring.
âœ… Diagnostics (errors, warnings).

ðŸ‘‰ LSP is like IntelliSense in VS Codeâ€”it makes coding smarter.

## DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) (through Mason)
DAP stands for Debug Adapter Protocol, and it is a protocol that allows debugging functionality to be integrated into text editors or IDEs. It enables the connection between a debugging client (like Neovim) and a debugging server (which can be a debugger for a specific programming language). This integration allows you to debug your code directly inside your editor.

DAP allows debugging inside NeoVim. It provides:
âœ… Breakpoints (F9)
âœ… Step Over / Step Into / Step Out
âœ… Variable inspection

ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s like a built-in debugger, similar to VS Code's debugger.
